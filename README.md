# 🏥 Hospital Database Management System

This project demonstrates a **Hospital Database Management System** using SQL. It is designed to showcase core database concepts such as table creation, constraints, relationships, queries, joins, functions, views, indexes, and stored procedures.

---

## 📌 Database Used

**Database Name:** `Hospital`

---

## 📘 Question-wise Explanation

### ✅ Q1 – Creating Tables with Constraints

**What I did:** Created three tables (`Doctor_details`, `Patient_details`, `Appointment_details`) using constraints like PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT, and AUTO_INCREMENT.

**What it will do:** Ensures data accuracy, uniqueness, and proper structure in the database.

**Why I used this:** Constraints maintain data integrity and prevent invalid data entry in a hospital system.

---

### ✅ Q2 – Inserting Meaningful Records

**What I did:** Inserted 15 realistic records into doctor, patient, and appointment tables.

**What it will do:** Provides sufficient data to test queries and relationships.

**Why I used this:** Meaningful data helps demonstrate real-world usage of the database.

---

### ✅ Q3 – Using Date Data Type

**What I did:** Used DATE datatype for hire date, registration date, and appointment date.

**What it will do:** Stores dates accurately and allows date-based filtering.

**Why I used this:** Dates are essential for tracking hospital operations.

---

### ✅ Q4 – Foreign Key Relationships

**What I did:** Linked appointments with doctors and patients using foreign keys.

**What it will do:** Maintains referential integrity between related tables.

**Why I used this:** Ensures appointments cannot exist without valid doctors and patients.

---

### ✅ Q5 – DISTINCT Keyword

**What I did:** Used DISTINCT to retrieve unique doctor specializations.

**What it will do:** Removes duplicate values from the result.

**Why I used this:** To identify different medical specializations available.

---

### ✅ Q6 – UPDATE, ALTER, RENAME

**What I did:** Updated doctor availability, altered patient table, and renamed appointment table.

**What it will do:** Modifies existing data and structure without recreating tables.

**Why I used this:** Databases often evolve with changing requirements.

---

### ✅ Q7 – SQL Operators

**What I did:** Used operators like LIKE, BETWEEN, IS NOT NULL, IN, and NOT.

**What it will do:** Filters records based on multiple conditions.

**Why I used this:** Operators help retrieve specific and meaningful data.

---

### ✅ Q8 – ORDER BY and LIMIT

**What I did:** Sorted patients by age and limited the output.

**What it will do:** Displays top records in sorted order.

**Why I used this:** Useful for reporting and analysis.

---

### ✅ Q9 – Aggregate Functions

**What I did:** Used COUNT with GROUP BY and HAVING.

**What it will do:** Generates summary data.

**Why I used this:** Aggregate functions help analyze grouped data.

---

### ✅ Q10 – SQL Joins

**What I did:** Used INNER, LEFT, RIGHT joins and UNION.

**What it will do:** Combines data from multiple tables.

**Why I used this:** Hospital data is interconnected.

---

### ✅ Q11 – UNION and UNION ALL

**What I did:** I used UNION and UNION ALL to combine doctor names.

**What it will do:** UNION displays a single list of names without duplicates, while UNION ALL displays all names including duplicates.

**Why I used this:** This helps to merge similar data from multiple tables into one result set and understand the difference between UNION and UNION ALL.


---

### ✅ Q12 – Subqueries

**What I did:** Used single-row and multi-row subqueries.

**What it will do:** Filters data based on results of another query.

**Why I used this:** Simplifies complex query logic.

---

### ✅ Q13 – Numeric and Date Functions

**What I did:** Used arithmetic and YEAR() function.

**What it will do:** Performs calculations and extracts date parts.

**Why I used this:** Functions help process stored data.

---

### ✅ Q14 – Views and Indexes

**What I did:** Created a view and an index.

**What it will do:** Simplifies queries and improves performance.

**Why I used this:** Enhances efficiency and reusability.

---

### ✅ Q15 – Stored Procedure

**What I did:** Created a stored procedure to fetch doctor appointments.

**What it will do:** Executes reusable logic with parameters.

**Why I used this:** Improves performance, security, and reusability.
